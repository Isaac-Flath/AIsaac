This library is a work in progress to become a deep learning library for
my own use.

The code in this library is heavily inspired by the miniai library
developed as part of the part 2 course. I am writing the Deep Learning
portions myself, but other parts of the library are taken directly from
that library (ie memory cleaning functions, plotting helper functions,
etc.). This is very much a work in progress at the very early/beginning
stages. Itâ€™s not ready for practical use (yet!).

## Install

Cone the repo and do an editable install. You will almost certainly need
to modify the library as you use it given the early stages it is in.

``` sh
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## How to use

### Minimal Example

### Dataloaders

- Pytorch Datasets

### Data Augmentation

#### Use Existing Augmentations

- Item vs Batch Aug
- CPU vs GPU Aug

#### Add New Augmentation

- Item vs Batch Aug
- CPU vs GPU Aug
- Random Erasing, torchvision, albumentations

### Models

- Pytorch Model
- Timm Model
- HuggingFace Model
- Resnet

### Metrics

- Create New Metric

### Loss Functions

- Use Existing Loss Function
- Create Loss Function

### Model Evaluations

- Plot Loss
